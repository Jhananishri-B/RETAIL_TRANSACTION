# Retail Transactions Data Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes retail transaction data from `Retail_Transactions_2000.csv` using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Project Structure

- `RETAIL_TRANSACTION (2).ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, cleaning, feature engineering, encoding, and visualization.
- `Retail_Transactions_2000.csv`: Raw dataset containing 2000 retail transactions.
- `Retail_Cleaned.csv`: Cleaned dataset generated by the notebook.
- `Retail_Cleaned_Encoded.csv`: Encoded and normalized dataset for machine learning tasks.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the notebook**  
   Open `RETAIL_TRANSACTION (2).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and execute the cells step by step.

## Workflow Overview

### Part A: Data Preprocessing Tasks

- **Data Inspection**: Load and inspect the dataset for missing values and duplicates.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Check for and handle any missing values.
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardize categorical values and filter invalid records.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as `TotalAmount`, `DayOfWeek`, `Month`, and `AgeGroup`.
- **Encoding & Transformation**: Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.
- **Final Verification**: Save cleaned and encoded datasets.

### Part B: Data Visualization Tasks

- **Customer Demographics**: Visualize age, gender, and city distributions.
- **Sales Insights**: Analyze sales by product category, month, and payment mode.
- **Advanced Insights**: Explore average spend by age group, top cities by revenue, and product category vs payment mode.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- plotly
- streamlit

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for details.

## Usage

- Modify the file path in the notebook if your CSV is located elsewhere.
- Run all cells to generate cleaned data and visualizations.
- Use the saved CSV files for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
